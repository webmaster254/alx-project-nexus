### Challenge: Database Performance at Scale

**Solution:** Implemented database sharding, connection pooling, and query optimization techniques. Utilized Django's select_related and prefetch_related methods to reduce N+1 query problems.

### Challenge: API Response Times

**Solution:** Introduced multi-level caching strategy using Redis and in-memory caching. Implemented background task processing with Celery for time-consuming operations.

### Challenge: System Reliability

**Solution:** Developed comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and circuit breakers. Implemented health checks and monitoring to proactively identify issues.

### Challenge: Security Vulnerabilities

**Solution:** Conducted regular security audits, implemented rate limiting, and followed OWASP security guidelines. Used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Best Practices

- **Code Organization:** Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing:** Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Monitoring:** Instrumentation for performance metrics and error tracking
- **Code Quality:** Consistent style guides, linting, and code reviews
- **Security:** Regular security audits and following security best practices
- **Version Control:** Feature branching, semantic versioning, and meaningful commit messages

## Personal Takeaways

- Backend development requires a balance between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation
- Investing time in proper architecture design pays dividends in maintainability
- Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task
- Collaboration and clear communication are as important as technical skills
- Continuous learning is essential to stay current with evolving technologies
- Building resilient systems requires anticipating failure modes and designing for recovery
- Understanding business requirements is crucial for making appropriate technical decisions

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Django 4.2+ with Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14+
- **Authentication:** JWT using djangorestframework-simplejwt
- **Documentation:** drf-spectacular for OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Testing:** pytest-django with factory-boy

## Development

The project uses modular settings:

- `config.settings.development` - Development settings (default for manage.py)
- `config.settings.production` - Production settings (used by WSGI/ASGI)
- `config.settings.base` - Base settings shared by all environments
